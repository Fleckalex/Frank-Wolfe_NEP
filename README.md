# Frank-Wolfe_NEP
Basic Implementation of the algorithm Frank-Wolfe with Nearest Extreme Point Oracle replicating the results presented with the Algorithm by D.Garber and Noam Wolf.
The file Algorithm1Paper.py produces a comparison  in terms of iterations between Frank-Wolfe with NEP and the Standard Frank-Wolfe Algorithm
The file Github_Alg1vs_Standard.png contains a plot with a comparison in terms of iterations between Frank-Wolfe with NEP and the Standard Frank-Wolfe Algorithm
